# prototype

My First prototype stage in my final software project.

I am developing a smart security camera that will use facial recognition to compare the person detected on the raspberry pi camera to a list of pictures of approved users given by the user so the system can verify that the person detected is definitely an intruder.

As this is a prototype for the midpoint presentation there was only a few points that were focused on and developed such as: 

A register/login feature that uses mysql(myphpadmin)

The main GUI (containing details of the service, sample photo database with stock photos, and an access to a stream from the raspberrypi camera module).

The stream from the raspberrypi camera accessed via the machines IP address in the url bar.


FYI

The connect.php has been removed for security reasons.

The Python code on the raspberryPi for the stream page has yet to be added.
